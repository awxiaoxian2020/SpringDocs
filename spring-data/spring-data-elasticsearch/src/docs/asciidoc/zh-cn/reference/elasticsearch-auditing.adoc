== Elasticsearch Auditing

=== Preparing entities

In order for the auditing code to be able to decide wether an entity instance is new, the entity must implement the `Persistable<ID>` interface which is defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
package org.springframework.data.domain;

import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;

public interface Persistable<ID> {
    @Nullable
    ID getId();

    boolean isNew();
}
----

As the existence of an Id is not a sufficient criterion to determine if an enitity is new in Elasticsearch, additional information is necessary. One way is to use the creation-relevant auditing fields for this decision:

A `Person` entity might look as follows - omitting getter and setter methods for brevity:

[source,java]
----
@Document(indexName = "person")
public class Person implements Persistable<Long> {
    @Id private Long id;
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;
    @Field(type = FieldType.Date, format = DateFormat.basic_date_time)
    private Instant createdDate;
    private String createdBy
    @Field(type = FieldType.Date, format = DateFormat.basic_date_time)
    private Instant lastModifiedDate;
    private String lastModifiedBy;

    public Long getId() {                                                 <1>
        return id;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isNew() {
        return id == null || (createdDate == null && createdBy == null);  <2>
    }
}
----
<1> the getter also is the required implementation from the interface
<2> an object is new if it either has no `id` or none of fields containing creation attributes are set.

=== Activating auditing

After the entities have been set up and providing the `AuditorAware` the Auditing must be activated by setting the `@EnableElasticsearchAuditing` on a configuration class:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableElasticsearchRepositories
@EnableElasticsearchAuditing
class MyConfiguration {
   // configuration code
}
----

If your code contains more than one `AuditorAware` bean for different types, you must provide the name of the bean to use as an argument to the `auditorAwareRef` parameter of the 
 `@EnableElasticsearchAuditing` annotation.
